COMPILATION
Change the filename in Main.cpp to select the script to be rendered.
eg. std::string filename = "Assets/sample.lua";
Ensure all scripts (and the script filename) specify filenames relative
to the A4 directory
(so .obj files in Assets, must be specified with Assets/<filename>.obj)
Run using this command in the A4 directory:
./A4
