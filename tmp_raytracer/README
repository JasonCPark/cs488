COMPILATION
Change the filename in Main.cpp to select the script to be rendered.
eg. std::string filename = "Assets/sample.lua";
Ensure all scripts (and the script filename) specify filenames relative
to the A4 directory
(so .obj files in Assets, must be specified with Assets/<filename>.obj)
Run using this command in the A4 directory:
./A4


=================================================
MANUAL
Adjust features of ray tracer by changing the values of the global variable flags in A4.cpp.
WARNING: Enabling all flags (especially motion blur and depth of field) drastically slows rendering time.


Texture Mapping (Meshes only):
Create a .obj file with additional "t" commands for each mesh face. Formatted as follows:
t <face_index> <relative_file_pathname>
eg.
t 0 Assets/checkerboard.png
Faces are 0-indexed in the order they appear in the .obj.

Refraction:
gr.material has been modified to take in another float argument after shininess.
This is the index of refraction, and the material will refract light if set to any
value greater than 0.

Glossy Reflection/Transmission:
gr.material will also take in another boolean argument after index of refraction,
which indicates if this material will demonstrate glossy reflection/transmission.

Motion Blur:
Enable the motion blur flag, then for the object you wish to give motion blur, when creating the shape
in the .lua, give it an extra vec3 argument describing its vector of movement.
eg.
ball = gr.nh_sphere('ball', {-2, 3, -6}, 3, {0,1.5,0})
